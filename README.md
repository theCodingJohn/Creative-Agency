# Creative Agency
It is one of the challenges in frontendmentor.io. The challenge is to build out this single page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.    

The user should be able to:
- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Navigate the slider using either their mouse/trackpad or keyboard

## Languages and Tools
- React
- Javascript
- Scss
- Html
- Netlify
